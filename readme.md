## This is Silkworm
It's an awesome piece of interactive, generative art. To use:

* Create a local network and connect to it on your phone
* <code>npm install</code>
* <code>node app.js</code>
* <code>node getIp.js</code>
* On your phone, navigate to /phone on the IP that getIp returns (on port 8080)
* On your browser, navigate to /browser on the same IP (on port 8080)
* Touch your phone, and wet yourself. It's so beautiful. NOTE: You won't see any awesomeness on your phone, but you will on your browser.
